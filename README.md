# Wrangle-and-analyze-data
Using Python and its libraries, data is gathered from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, its quality and tidiness is assessed, then cleaned. The data wrangling process. 

The wrangling efforts are documented in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries)

The dataset wrangled, analyzing and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

The tasks in this project are as follows:

    Step 1: Gathering data

    Step 2: Assessing data

    Step 3: Cleaning data

    Step 4: Storing data

    Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data

    Step 6: Reporting
    
There is a 'wrangle_report' file for more information on the datasets used and the analysis process, and a 'act_report' file for the findings.
